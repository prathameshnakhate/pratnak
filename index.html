            Hello everyone, Prathamesh here,
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a 3rd year Undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay majoring in Mechanical
            engineering and pursuing a minor in Systems and Control Engineering. Till now I have done many projects in my department,
            the list of those can be found in the next section of this website. As for hobbies I like to play football and do swimming. I also enjoy playing
            guitar and making RC planes

                    <p>
                        Aim to understand and analyze the coherent structures formed in flow fields by using Reduced Order Modelling techniques like 
                        Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Dynamic Mode Decomposition. We analyzed a jet impingment flow field and found out that maximum 
                        amount of vortices form for a Strouhal number of 0.15. I had also proposed a POD based method to rank the DMD modes on the basis of energy

                        responsive so that it can be comfortably viewed on any device. This website is also completely developed by me.
